# RepCounter
A threshold independent, lightweight, repetition counting software built using OpenCV, MediaPipe and Scipyâ€™s peak detector. The angle at some body joint is tracked, the data is filtered and peaks are detected which gives an idea of the repetition count. Further improvements are made in real time.
